This repository has made for my thesis.

This lib helps to controll and measure with totalstation with camera on its eyepiece. For the controlling and measuring I use a Raspberry Pi and a picamera, so the lib require the connected modules (picamera and GPIO), moreover for the totalstaion conrroling you need the ULYXES module (https://github.com/zsiki/ulyxes) and OpenCV (https://github.com/opencv/opencv) is necessary too for the image processing
